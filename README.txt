The powershell script file and all .bat files need to be together in the same folder to work

User CopyAssetsUnparametrized.bat to manually input the destination and source folder

Copy then Right click and Edit CopyAssetsWithParamsExample.bat to create a predefined destination and source pair
for repeated use

All custom .bat files contain MY desination folder so just replace that with your own

Recently the ability to add a second source path was added through the parameter -SourcePathSecond

ENJOY!
